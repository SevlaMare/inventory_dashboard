*slicers with same name will conflict, with overwrite.

RTK query
1 setup: api must live on provider (redux store or apiProvider)
  one provider per app, so no apiProvider, use the reduxStore!
  inject the API and the API middleware in the store config.

2 create an slice to consume a resource/endpoint
  using createApi function from toolkit (eg services/api/products/products.ts)
  attach the slice(createApi instance) in the combineReducers
    [productApi.reducerPath]: productApi.reducer,
  apply the middleware
    .concat(productApi.middleware);

error:
Actions must be plain objects. Use custom middleware for async actions.
(thunk is disable, or saga is not setup properly)
