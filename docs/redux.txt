I -setup
1 inject redux (aka state machine)
  ReduxProvider, comes built-in, so just wrap the app. (main.tsx)
  the provider receive the store (state object with default values)

2 define the STORE
  aggregate the REDUCERs
  inject middlewares (eg for async state changes handling)

3 create SLICES by features
  define the initial state
  define REDUCERs (functions that modify the state for this feature)
  export the actions (name operations to modify the state)
  export the reducer (to be injected in the store)
-------------
II - persist store (subscribe to changes (autosave) or manual) + 


-------------
III - making a new feature
1 create the feature component, inject in a page.
  optional don't use redux yet. make it work then extract.

2 create SLICE: 
  new file, copy template
  rename actions/exports
  create reducers fxs
  import slicer on redux store

3 from component, import the slice to apply the reducers 
  dispatch actions to peform state changes.
